Steps:

* Use the rendered `<article>` tag as the main point of the letter.
* Make sure you include the image with the `rocketree.io` domain, rather
  than local domain.
* include the following html blob:
```html
<div>
  <p>
    <i>This is a post from <a href="https://rocketree.io">rocketree.io</a>. For
    more posts and live updates, please check out <a href="https://rocketree.io">the site</a>.
    Thanks!
    </i>

</div>
```
