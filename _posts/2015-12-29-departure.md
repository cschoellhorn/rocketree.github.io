We are off! I'm writing this from the front seat of our Xterra.

After Christmas, it was a mad dash to finish getting ourselves and the Xterra ready for our trip.

On December 28, 2015 at 3:45PM, we took off. The odometer read XXXXXX.

Some of the things we were doing:

* Finishing our window blinds
* Adding hinges to our platform bed
* Fixing the back right car door to open properly. (A remnant of rolling the car last year)
* Replacing the car battery and wiper blades. Finishing a small bit of touchup paint.
* Hanging our interior lights
* Packing and preparation

It comes as no surprise to many reading this but the weather has been unseasonably warm on the east coast, this was a real blessing for getting the car ready.

We made it from DC to past Columbus, Ohio on the first day of driving.

Our first night sleeping in our assembled vehicle was great! We both slept well. It was, however, pouring down rain. This meant that we had to get ourselves ready (aka changing) and the car ready (blinds) while both being inside the car. It was not particularly graceful and something we'll be improving.

Notes so far:

* Gas is really cheap in the middle of the country. (We saw $1.579/gal today)
* Missouri is flooding really badly.
* 1,700+ is a large number of miles to be traveling by car
